        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Nacatamales are a traditional dish found in Nicaragua wrapped in banana or plaintain leaves
            and steamed for anywhere between 4 to 6 hours they are filled with a vast variety of ingredients that can include
            things such as but not limited to pork, rice, olives, japanenos, prunes and slices of potatoes.
             The masa is usually softer than the common Mexican tamales and easily falls apart. 
            I recommend eating these tamales with a fork.
